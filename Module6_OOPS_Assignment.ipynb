        " 1 - Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class.\n",
        " 2- Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        " 3- Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables the ability to use the same interface or method name for different underlying data types or classes.\n",
        " 4- Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on exposing only the essential details of an object while hiding its complex implementation.\n",
        " 5- Composition: Composition involves building complex objects by combining other objects. It focuses on a \"has-a\" relationship instead of the \"is-a\" relationship provided by inheritance."
